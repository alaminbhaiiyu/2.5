## 📝 **Introduction**

**Goat Bot V2.5 - Unofficials** is a customized version of **Goat Bot V2**, a powerful chatbot designed for group management, task automation, and entertainment features on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger. This version has been modified to remove dependencies on the Google Drive API, simplifying deployment and eliminating authentication requirements.

**Important Notes**:
- This is **not** the original **Goat Bot V2**. The original version was developed by **[NTKhang](https://github.com/ntkhang03)** and can be found at [https://github.com/ntkhang03/Goat-Bot-V2](https://github.com/ntkhang03/Goat-Bot-V2).
- We strongly encourage you to visit the original repository to support the author and receive official updates.
- The bot uses an unofficial API ([fb-chat-api](https://github.com/ntkhang03/fb-chat-api)), which may result in Facebook account bans due to spam. Use a clone account to avoid risks. **We are not responsible for any issues arising from using this bot.**

## 💡 **How It Works**

The bot uses Facebook's unofficial API to send and receive messages. When a new event occurs (message, reaction, member joining/leaving a group, etc.), the bot processes it through `handlerEvents`. Key functions include:  

- **onStart**: Checks and executes commands when invoked by users.  
- **onChat**: Handles regular messages.  
- **onFirstChat**: Processes the first message in a group since the bot started.  
- **onReaction**: Handles reactions to messages registered in `GoatBot.onReaction`.  
- **onReply**: Handles replies to messages registered in `GoatBot.onReply`.  
- **onEvent**: Handles events like members joining/leaving a group.  
- **handlerEvent**: Runs event commands from the `scripts/events` folder.  

Details on how it works can be found in the [original README](https://github.com/ntkhang03/Goat-Bot-V2#how-it-works).  

**Notes on Goat Bot V2.5 - Unofficials**:  
- This version removes dependencies on the Google Drive API to simplify setup and eliminate authentication requirements.  
- Some features may not work if they rely on Google Drive.
